title: "Trial Design"
include_overview: true
output: html_document
questions:
 - What kind of on-farm experiments do we do?
 - How do we design these experiments efficiently?
objectives:
 - Know different types of common on-farm experiments
 - Import boundary file and AB line file
 - Create AB line file with code
 - utilize the functions to create simple trial designs
keypoints:
 - Most of the code in this part would be using the functions, therefore understanding what different functions can be quite important
 - In designing the trials, the most important thing is to know how to design the experimental rates,and the tech part can be done by someone else
