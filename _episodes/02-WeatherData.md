title: "Weather Data"
include_overview: true
questions:
 - What are the common file types in agricultural data?
 - What publicly available datasets exist for my field?
objectives:
 - Describe the format of public weather and soil datasets
 - Import weather data from the internet, eg. daymetr
 - Access to elevation and ssurgo data with higher resolution
 - Derive topography data from elevation data
keypoints:
 - sf is preferable for data analysis; it is easier to access the dataframe
 - Projecting your data in utm is necessary for many of the geometric operations you perform (e.g. making trial grids and splitting plots into subplot data)
 - Compare different data formats, such as gpkg, shp(cpg,dbf,prj,sbn,sbx),geojson,tif

> # Daymet Weather Data
> 
> The Oak Ridge National Laboratory produces a datset called Daymet which contains predicted
> weather observations on a one meter grid. These data come from weather station climate 
> observations in a climate model for prediction and include variables such as precipitation,
> snow water equivalent, temperature, day length, solar radians, and vapor pressure. 
> 
>There is a package in r `daymetr` that downloads the daymet weather data within the R environment.
> For a single point, you can use the command `download_daymet()`. If you want to download the data 
> for a set of points, there is also the command `download_daymet_batch()` which takes an argument 
> a .csv of the points in lat/long. If you want to use this approach, we can give you an example. 
>

> # Using daymetr to download weather
> We will use the mean latitude and longitude values from the bounding box as our point for the 
> weather data. The functions `cent_long()` and `cent_lat()` give the mean longitude and latitude points of the bounding box around the `sf` object that is supplied. This should be a point near the middle of the field.

> # Dates in Dataframes 
> **DENA: What's the goal here? What are we going to be doing with the dates once we have them? A sentence or two about that would help with contextualizing it rather than jumping into the fact that R has it without telling us how we'll use it.**
> There are many operations we might do with dates, such as eliminating the dates outside of the growing season, but there is a class within R for dates. Once a column is of the `date` class, we can perform actions
> like ordering the data by time, finding the data in a certain time period, or calculating the days between two dates. 
> The function `as.Date()` converts a column to a date, but here if we try 
> the command `weather_data$date <- as.Date(weather_data$yday)`, we will receive an error 
> saying an origin must be supplied. 
>
> The function can see that the date is in days after some starting time or origin. The name
> `yday` means this is the day of the year, so the origin should be the last day of the 
> previous year. There are multiple years in our dataframe, so the origin should change 
> for each year. This is accomplished in the function as.Date.daymetr(). To see this code and understand how > it works go to the [functions script](https://github.com/data-carpentry-for-agriculture/trial-lesson/blob/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/functions.R) in github.

> # Unit Conversions
>
>Publicly available data are usually given in metric units as we saw in the weather data 
>above. We may want to have these data in imperial units as these are the units we are using
>to think about yield and other values in the United States. You may know the value of crop requirements and threshholds in imperial units rather than metric units. For example, a goal of 18 inches of rain during the corn season.
>
>The package `measurements` is used for converting different types of measurements from one unit to another. The 
> command `conv_unit()` converts the column from one stated unit to another unit.
> Another useful function in the package is `conv_unit_options` which gives the possible units for a specific kind of measure (e.g. length, area, weight, etc.). 
> 
> We have made simple functions for converting units using `conv_unit()` these are in `functions.R` and can be sourced within your code. For example, the function `mm_to_in()` can convert the daily precipitation from milimeters to inches. The following lines converts `prcp..mm.day.` to inches and creates a new column called `prec`.

> Perhaps you want to see what the weather this year was like compared to the typical year.
> We are going make a graph showing the total monthly precipitation from
> 2018 compared to the average precipitation from the years 2000 to 2017. This is a common way

> # Adding a month variable
> 
> Currently, there is no month variable in our dataframe. Once you have a date object, there is a package called `lubridate`
> that facilitates additional time or date related calculations. Perhaps you want a new column with the day of the week or a measure of time lapsed between two observations. We use the command `month()` to add a 
> variable called `month` to the dataframe. The option `label = TRUE` creates a string with the 
> month name instead of a number. We use this option because the month name will look better on the graph than a number.

> # Taking sum or average by groups

> Now, we need to sum the daily precipitation for each year and month combination. There is a

> command `summarise()` which defines the action. For this exercise we wrote functions that use `dplyr` to make the task simpler for you. The functions `sumprec_by_monthyear()` and `avgprec_by_month()` are in `functions.R`. You can read these functions to make similar functions on your own.

A subset is a set of observations that are all present in an existing dataframe; generally, the subset will have some characteristic in common such as year, month, etc. The function `subset()` requires two inputs, the dataframe to be subsetted and the characteristics to subset on in the form of logical expressions. We will take the subset of `by_month_year` that is in 2018.
