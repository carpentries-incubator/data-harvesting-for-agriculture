title: "Data Cleaning"
questions:
- "Why is it important to clean the data before proceeding with analysis?"
- "How can I quickly and efficiently identify problems with my data?"
- "How can identify and remove incorrect values from my dataset?"
objectives:
- "Confirm that data are formatted correctly"
- "Enumerate common problems encountered with data formatting."
- "Visualize the distribution of recorded values"
- "Identify and remove outliers in a dataset using R and QGIS"
- "Correct other issues specific to how data were collected"

keypoints:
- "Comparison operators such as `>`, `<`, and `==` can be used to identify values that exceed or equal certain values."
- "All the cleaning in the arcgis/qgis can be done by r, but we need to check the updated shapefile in qrcgis/qgis. Including removing observations that has greater than 2sd harvester speed, certain headlands, or being too close to the plot borders"
- "The `filter` function in `dplyr` removes rows from a data frame based on values in one or more columns."
