title: "Trial Data"
questions:
 - What are the common file types in agricultural data?
objectives:
 - Import agricultural datasets into R
 - Describe the contents of files generated during planting, fertilization, and harvest
 - Describe the contents of files used to control seeding and fertilization rate
 - Assess the accuracy of machinery in applying the target rates
keypoints:
 - sf is prefereable for data analysis; it is easier to access the dataframe
 - Projecting your data in utm is necessary for many of the geometric operations you perform (e.g. making trial grids and splitting plots into subplot data)
 - Compare different data formats, such as gpkg, shp(cpg,dbf,prj,sbn,sbx),geojson,tif
