title: "Aggregation of spatial data"
questions:
- "How can I calculate the mean value for a plot within my trial?"
- "How can I combine multiple geospatial layers?"
objectives:
- "Split raster data into a grid representing units one wants to analyze"
- "Calculate a mean value for each cell in the grid"
- "Stack data from different datasets together"
keypoints:
- "Geospatial layers that will be analyzed together should all be clipped to one size."
