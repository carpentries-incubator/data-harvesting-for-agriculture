I"c<p>Data Carpentry’s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, 
and tools for working with data so that they can get more done in 
less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for 
those interested in working with agricultural data in R.</p>

<p>This is an introduction to R designed for participants with no 
programming experience. These lessons can be taught in 2 days. They start with some basic information about R syntax, the 
RStudio interface, and move through how to import CSV files and SSURGO data, the 
structure of data frames, and how to import and manipulate agricultural shape files.</p>
