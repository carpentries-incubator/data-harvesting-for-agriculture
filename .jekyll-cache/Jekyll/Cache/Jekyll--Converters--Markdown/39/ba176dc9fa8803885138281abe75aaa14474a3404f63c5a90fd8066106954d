<p>Put together, there are about 4 to 5 Gb of software and data to install.
This takes some time over most home network connections, so we are creating installed USB drives 
that you can copy from.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to take the software with you, we recommend that you copy it to your
computer’s C drive. The Center for Digital Agriculture needs the USB drives back
at the end of the workshop.</strong></p>

<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate programs. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R 
in the background.  You do not need to run it separately.</p>

<h3 id="use-the-start-menu-folder-for-where-you-want-to-use-it">Use the “start menu” folder for where you want to use it</h3>
<p>When these USB drives were created, they were assigned the letter D on a Windows computer.
However, if you copy to your own computer’s hard drive, that will probably be C.</p>

<p>On Windows, you can skip the 5 Gb download process by copying the DataHarvestingWin folder
to the root level of your C drive and running it from  there. (Your new path should be
C:\DataHarvestingWin\ as opposed to the old path of D:\DataHarvestingWin.)</p>

<h3 id="launching-the-programs-windows">Launching the programs (Windows)</h3>
<p>Within DataHarvestingWin, the <strong>folders with Start Menu in their names</strong> contain shortcuts
to run the software.</p>

<p>Choose the version that corresponds to the drive you’re planning to run it from –
C if you copy the folders to your own computer, and probably D if you run from the USB
drive.</p>

<p>If you’re running from USB but it wasn’t assigned the letter D, find:</p>

<p>DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/RStudio/bin/rstudio.exe</p>

<p>and double-click it to run.</p>

<p>The first time you run R Studio, you’ll be prompted to select your installation of R.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the <strong>“Choose a specific version of R”</strong> item next to the large text box.</li>
  <li>Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate to:</li>
</ol>

<p>DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/R/R-3.6.2/</p>

<p>and choose <strong>Select Folder.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll be given a choice between 32 bit and 64 bit; either should work, but 64 bit
is likely to be what your computer is capable of.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the Start folder’s shortcut doesn’t work for you in QGIS, and you get an error message about a 
missing DLL, there’s a location mismatch to resolve. Ask a class helper for assistance 
in switching the .env file that you’re using.</p>

<h3 id="launching-the-programs-from-the-usb-drive-mac">Launching the programs from the USB drive (Mac)</h3>
<p>Macs won’t allow you to run software from a USB drive the way Windows will, but we’ve copied the installation files here to save you the downloading time.</p>

<p>For Macs, you can follow the instructions at <a href="https://data-carpentry-for-agriculture.github.io/trial-lesson/10-Installing-R-on-Mac/index.html">“Installing R and R Studio on a Mac”</a>, but instead of downloading from the Internet, look in the DataHarvestingMac folder for your files.</p>

<h3 id="manual-installation-in-advance">Manual installation in advance</h3>
<p>If you’d like to get started before the workshop, and don’t mind the download and installation time, you can also follow the manual installation instructions available here:</p>
