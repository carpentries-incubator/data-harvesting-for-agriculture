<h1 id="programming-concepts-and-language">Programming concepts and language</h1>

<p>Programming doesn‚Äôt have to be scary, and we have some real-world examples to help you understand what‚Äôs going on with these words we‚Äôre typing in a window. The words in bold will come up in a programming context later on, but it might help to have a mental reference picture to associate with these words.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs imagine that instead of a program to work with numbers and letters, we‚Äôre creating a program that cooks breakfast instead.</p>

<p>In order to make breakfast, you need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <strong>working directory</strong> (the place where you‚Äôre doing things, such as your kitchen countertop)</li>
  <li>Available data (information about what you‚Äôre working with)
    <ul>
      <li>Data could be an inventory of your pantry, a grocery shopping list, a map of the store, a collection of prices at the store, and so forth.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Types of objects‚Äì a method of grouping what can be done to what types of things.
    <ul>
      <li>Food is one type of thing; people are another; pets are a third.</li>
      <li>A specific food object can be an egg or a pancake; a particular pet object can be your cat or your dog.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some inputs that may be objects of appropriate types (breakfast food ingredients)
    <ul>
      <li>You create breakfast by performing actions on objects of food types, and then you feed it to things of the people and pet types.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some functions (recipes that work with the ingredients)
    <ul>
      <li>Inputs to functions are usually stored in variables ‚Äì you don‚Äôt always want to make the same thing every day, so the instructions have placeholder names for things that are similar to each other but may vary. (A ‚Äútodays_cheese‚Äù variable could hold Stilton for one day‚Äôs omelet and cheddar for the next.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You need to match your object types to your functions.
    <ul>
      <li>You shouldn‚Äôt use a pet-type object as an input to a breakfast-making function. (Nobody wants to eat the goldfish for breakfast.)</li>
      <li>You might be able to use a dinner-type food object as an input to a breakfast-making function, but use caution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Some outputs (food ready to be consumed)</li>
  <li>A destination (where to put the food that‚Äôs ready to be consumed)
    <ul>
      <li>You could put your outputs in your working directory (eat breakfast in your kitchen) or you could send it to another location (put leftovers in the refrigerator)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
