<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R in the background.  You do not need to run it separately. After installing both programs, you will need to install the
<strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code></strong> package from within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for
your operating system, and then follow the instructions to install
<strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-already-have-r-and-rstudio-installed">If you already have R and RStudio installed</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Open RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is
  available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.</li>
  <li>To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are
running. Alternatively, you can type <code class="highlighter-rouge">sessionInfo()</code>, which will also display
which version of R you are running. Go on
the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">CRAN website</a> and check
whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
it. You can <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f">check here</a> for
more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.</li>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Follow the instructions for your distribution
from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux">CRAN</a>, they provide information
to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo yum install R</code>), but we
don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this approach are
usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.3.1.</li>
  <li>Go to the
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download page</a></li>
  <li>Under <em>Installers</em> select the version that matches your distribution, and
install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo dpkg -i
rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).</li>
  <li>Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any
error messages.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-everyone">For everyone</h3>

<p><strong>After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code> package.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>After starting RStudio, at the console type:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">install.packages(c("tidyverse"))</code></li>
</ul>
