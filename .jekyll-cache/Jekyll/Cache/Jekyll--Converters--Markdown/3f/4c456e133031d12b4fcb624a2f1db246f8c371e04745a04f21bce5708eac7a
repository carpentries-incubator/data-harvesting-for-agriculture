  <p>While R Studio is fantastic at doing calculations that you could then turn into visualizations, the visualizations themselves are sometimes not very high resolution.</p>

  <p>For example, the as-planted.gpkg file R Studio displays like this:
<img src="../figure/qgis_figs/image5.png" width="30%" /></p>

  <p>The same file would look more like this in QGIS:
<img src="../figure/qgis_figs/image8.png" width="30%" /></p>

  <p>You can zoom in on each of those areas for higher resolution and see that the wavy areas have higher density application than originally intended:
<img src="../figure/qgis_figs/image10.png" width="30%" /></p>

  <p>In QGIS, you can place one layer over another for comparison, as well.</p>

  <p>Later on in the lessons, we‚Äôll be using R Studio to provide us with calculations that compare the intended rate of application with the actual rate of application to see how accurate the equipment was.</p>

  <p>However, R Studio provides those visualizations side by side:
<img src="../figure/qgis_figs/image17.png" width="60%" /></p>

  <p>QGIS lets you layer them directly on top of each other and zoom in for more visual comparisons of particular segments, such as identifying where your actual planting or fertilization rates may be higher or lower than intended because of the way the equipment was driven:
<img src="../figure/qgis_figs/image4.png" width="30%" /></p>

  <p>This will be helpful during the data cleaning phase of the process.</p>

    <p>The USB drives were built so that when you copy the DataHarvestingWin folder from the USB drive to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\</code> drive, the QGIS Start Menu item will launch the software from that location for you.</p>

    <p>The shortcuts are located in <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\DataHarvestingWin\QGIS 3.10 Start Menu Links</code>. If you‚Äôd like, you can copy the icons inside that folder (and inside the R and R Studio folder) to your desktop for easier access later.</p>

    <p>QGIS takes about 2.5 GB of space when installed. If you don‚Äôt have enough hard drive space free for QGIS and are running from the USB drive during the lesson, we‚Äôll need to modify the environment file that tells QGIS where to find its components when launching.</p>

    <p>Inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\DataHarvestingWin\ProgramFiles\QGIS 3.10\bin\</code>, look around the <code class="highlighter-rouge">qgis-bin.env</code> section of the alphabet:</p>
