<p>Put together, there are about 4 to 5 Gb of software and data to install.  This takes some time over most home network connections, so we also provide USB drives with pre-installed data that you can copy the necessary files from.</p>

<p><strong>We have scheduled some time to complete the basic installation process together at the start of the workshop (about 30 minutes total)</strong>, but if you want to try on your own before, please see the ‚ÄúManual Installation in advance‚Äù section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate programs. R is the underlying statistical computing software, but using R alone is more difficult and obscure. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R in the background.  You do not need to run it separately.</p>

<p>If you want to install on your own, Mac installation time should be much faster than what we‚Äôve experienced on the Windows side:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Macs tend to install the software quickly, in about 20 minutes</li>
  <li>Windows machines install the software from scratch in 3‚Äì4 hours.  You can instead copy the programs from one of our USB disks in 10‚Äì20 minutes.  <strong>If you want to take the software with you, you will need to copy it to your computer. The Center for Digital Agriculture needs the USB drives back at the end of the workshop.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="usb-based-installation">USB-Based Installation</h3>

<p>You can install from the USB drives at the workshop to save download time.
Macs won‚Äôt allow you to run software from a USB drive the way Windows will, but we‚Äôve copied the installation files here to save you the downloading time.</p>

<p><strong>Note: If you want to take the software with you, we recommend that you copy it to your computer‚Äôs <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive. The Center for Digital Agriculture needs the USB drives back at the end of the workshop.</strong></p>

<p>The Windows manual installation process has taken 3-4 hours to complete in our test runs, so we have two much-faster options available for you based on our USB drives which should only take about 10-20 minutes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to keep the software and have about 5 Gb space free, at the workshop you can copy it from the USB stick to your computer‚Äôs C drive.</li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt have about 5 Gb of space free, you can run the software directly on the USB drive. (However, we‚Äôll need the USB sticks back at the end of the workshop.)</li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt want to wait for the workshop and want to download and install before you arrive, see ‚ÄúAlternate: Manual installation in advance‚Äù below.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="steps-to-install-using-a-usb-drive">Steps to install using a USB drive:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Copy the USB folder data to the correct hard drive.</p>

    <p>When these USB drives were created, they were assigned the letter <code class="highlighter-rouge">D:</code> on a Windows computer.  However, if you copy to your own computer‚Äôs hard drive, that will probably be <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:</code>.</p>

    <p>On Windows, you can skip the 5 Gb download process by copying the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DataHarvestingWin</code> folder to the root level of your <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:</code> drive and running it from  there. (Your new path should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:\DataHarvestingWin</code> as opposed to the old path of <code class="highlighter-rouge">D:\DataHarvestingWin</code>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Launch the programs</p>

    <p>Within DataHarvestingWin, the <strong>folders with Start Menu in their names</strong> contain shortcuts to run the software.</p>

    <p>Choose the version that corresponds to the drive you‚Äôre planning to run it on:  <code class="highlighter-rouge">C:</code> if you copy the folders to your own computer, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">D:</code> (most likely) if you run from the USB drive.</p>

    <p>If you‚Äôre running from USB but it wasn‚Äôt assigned the letter D, find:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/RStudio/bin/rstudio.exe
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>and double-click it to run.</p>

    <p>The first time you run RStudio, you‚Äôll be prompted to select your installation of R.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Choose the <strong>‚ÄúChoose a specific version of R‚Äù</strong> item next to the large text box.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate to:</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/R/R-3.6.2/
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>and choose <strong>Select Folder.</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>You have a choice between 32-bit and 64-bit; either should work, but 64-bit is more likely to fit a computer manufactured in the past decade.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the Start folder‚Äôs shortcut doesn‚Äôt work for you in QGIS, and you get an error message about a missing DLL, there‚Äôs a location mismatch to resolve. Ask a class helper for assistance in switching the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file that you‚Äôre using.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You can follow the installation instructions at <a href="extra-Installing-R-on-Windows/index.html">‚ÄúInstalling R and RStudio on a Windows‚Äù</a> page.  This may take several hours to complete on a Windows machine, and you shouldn‚Äôt plan on having time to complete this during the workshop itself.</p>
