I"–<p>Our motivation for creating this workshop is the recent, rapid increase in the volume of data produced on farms and the use of such data for decision making by farmers.  We don‚Äôt expect to replace the data analysis services that are currently provided by the Ag Tech industry, but we do want to arm you with knowledge to help you better communicate with those service providers.  Moreover, we believe that your data will be more valuable to you if you have some ability to analyze it yourself, regardless of whether you continue to do business with a particular company years in the future.</p>

<p>After attending our workshop, you will be able to develop small computer programs of your own for analysis, visualization, and decision making, and will be able to share those programs with others.</p>

<p>Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì we‚Äôre not asking you to develop research software from scratch! We‚Äôll be providing you with scripts and programs that will perform most of the work for you. However, helping you understand the way the software works will let you run different scenarios for yourself and decide among several alternatives for your business.</p>

<h2 id="what-youll-learn">What you‚Äôll learn</h2>

<p>By the end of this workshop, you will know more about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to understand more about the data coming from your agricultural equipment</li>
  <li>What you can do with it yourself using free and open source tools</li>
  <li>Where to find historical data relevant to your own farm and/or county‚Äôs location and land</li>
  <li>How to use both current and historical data about your own farm and/or county to develop custom fertilizing strategies that can improve cost effective application in your particular location</li>
</ul>

<p>To do this, we‚Äôll be introducing you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RStudio, free and open source software used for creating both programs and visualizations</li>
  <li>Geospatial data types that you may encounter, how to tell them apart, and how to use them for your own location</li>
  <li>Commonly used file formats that your agricultural equipment may provide, how to tell them apart, and how to know what to do with each of them</li>
  <li>Basic data cleaning processes so that you‚Äôll get more useful and effective results from analysis of your farm‚Äôs or your region‚Äôs data</li>
  <li>Ways to calculate the most cost-effective application rates and assess the effectiveness of the results</li>
  <li>How to design a custom set of variable application rates for your own farm, apply them, and analyze the results consistently across multiple years</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-bring">What to bring</h2>

<p>While our lessons are taught with sample data so that everyone can follow along with the same set of numbers and values and check their results, you can get additional benefits from this workshop if you bring along some data that‚Äôs relevant to your own farm.</p>

<p>Here‚Äôs what to bring to this workshop:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A laptop (Windows, Mac, or Linux)</li>
  <li>Past yield maps</li>
  <li>A boundary file for the areas you‚Äôd like to analyze</li>
  <li>Machinery widths (if you have them; if not, we can estimate)</li>
  <li>Any prescription maps you use for your fields</li>
  <li>(If you already do variable rate application) Past application maps</li>
  <li>A-B line or guidance line information</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="getting-connected-to-the-campus-network-as-a-guest">Getting connected to the campus network as a guest</h2>

<p>The IllinoisNet_Guest network allows University visitors to access the wireless network.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect to the IllinoisNet_Guest network.</li>
  <li>Visit <a href="http://illinois.edu">http://illinois.edu</a> and you‚Äôll be redirected to the guest network portal.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt use the NetID login section; that‚Äôs for University employees. Instead, click the guest link at the bottom of the page.</li>
  <li>Follow the ‚ÄúClick Here for Wi-Fi Access‚Äù prompt.</li>
  <li>Follow the prompts to provide the information to create a guest account.</li>
  <li>When you‚Äôre redirected to the illinois.edu home page, you‚Äôve completed the process.</li>
  <li>Guest access is granted one day at a time; for the next day, you‚Äôll need to log in to IllinoisNet_Guest again.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="some-workshop-guidelines">Some workshop guidelines</h2>

<p>We‚Äôll have instructors and helpers available throughout the day to help you get over any hurdles if you get stuck.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll use two colors of sticky notes for quick check-ins around the room to see if everyone‚Äôs caught up or needs help. If you‚Äôd like to signal for a helper, put the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù sticky note on the corner of your laptop screen and we‚Äôll come to assist.</p>

<h1 id="the-lesson-sequence">The lesson sequence</h1>

<ol type="1">
    <li> First, we‚Äôll get you set up with R, R Studio, and QGIS software.
     	 <ol type="a">
      	     <li> We‚Äôll help you add some specialized components to R Studio for use with geospatial data in general and this lesson in specific. </li>
     	     <li> We‚Äôll introduce you to some of the sample files that we‚Äôll be using in the lesson. </li>
   	 </ol>
 
    <li> Next, we‚Äôll introduce you to geospatial data, including file types and format types. </li>
    	 <ol type="a">
 	     <li> The most common coordinate reference systems (CRSes) are latitude/longitude (WGS84) and UTM.</li>
 	     <li> The most common file format options are shape files (four or five separate files working together) or geopackages (everything bundled in one ‚Äòbox‚Äô so it‚Äôs harder to lose a piece).</li>
 	     <li> We‚Äôll teach you to understand which you‚Äôre looking at and how to convert them from one type to another in order to be able to work with data from different sources.</li>
	 </ol>
