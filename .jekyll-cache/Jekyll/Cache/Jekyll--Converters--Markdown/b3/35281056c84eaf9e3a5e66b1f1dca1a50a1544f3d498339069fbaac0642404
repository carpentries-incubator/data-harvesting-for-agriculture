<p>Put together, there are about 4 to 5 Gb of software and data to install.
This takes some time over most home network connections, so we are creating installed USB drives 
that you can copy from.</p>

<p>We will have time to do this installation process together at the start of the workshop, but if you want to try on your own before, please see the “Manual Installation in advance” section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<!-- Windows installs (3-4 hours) take significantly longer than Mac (~20 minutes), so if you have a Windows machine and want to try to install anything before the workshop, be aware it will take some time. -->

<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate programs. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R 
in the background.  You do not need to run it separately.</p>

<p>If you want to install on your own, Mac installation time should be much faster than what we’ve experienced on the Windows side:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Macs install the software in about 20 minutes</li>
  <li>Windows install the software in 3-4 hours.  Note for Windows users: <strong>If you want to take the software with you, you will need to copy it to your computer. The Center for Digital Agriculture needs the USB drives back
at the end of the workshop.</strong></li>
</ul>

Macs won’t allow you to run software from a USB drive the way Windows will, but we’ve copied the installation files here to save you the downloading time.</p>

<p><strong>Note: If you want to take the software with you, we recommend that you copy it to your
computer’s C drive. The Center for Digital Agriculture needs the USB drives back
at the end of the workshop.</strong></p>

<p>The Windows manual installation process has taken 3-4 hours to complete in our test runs, so we have two much-faster options available for you based on our USB drives which should only take about 10-20 minutes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to keep the software and have about 5 Gb space free, at the workshop you can copy it from the USB stick to your computer’s C drive.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have about 5 Gb of space free, you can run the software directly on the USB drive. (However, we’ll need the USB sticks back at the end of the workshop.)</li>
  <li>If you don’t want to wait for the workshop and want to download and install before you arrive, see “Alternate: Manual installation in advance” below.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="1-use-the-start-menu-folder-for-where-you-want-to-use-it">#1. Use the “start menu” folder for where you want to use it</h5>
<p>When these USB drives were created, they were assigned the letter D on a Windows computer.
However, if you copy to your own computer’s hard drive, that will probably be C.</p>

<p>On Windows, you can skip the 5 Gb download process by copying the DataHarvestingWin folder
to the root level of your C drive and running it from  there. (Your new path should be
C:\DataHarvestingWin\ as opposed to the old path of D:\DataHarvestingWin.)</p>

<h5 id="2-launching-the-programs">#2. Launching the programs</h5>
<p>Within DataHarvestingWin, the <strong>folders with Start Menu in their names</strong> contain shortcuts
to run the software.</p>

<p>Choose the version that corresponds to the drive you’re planning to run it from –
C if you copy the folders to your own computer, and probably D if you run from the USB
drive.</p>

<p>If you’re running from USB but it wasn’t assigned the letter D, find:</p>

<p>DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/RStudio/bin/rstudio.exe</p>

<p>and double-click it to run.</p>

<p>The first time you run R Studio, you’ll be prompted to select your installation of R.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the <strong>“Choose a specific version of R”</strong> item next to the large text box.</li>
  <li>Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate to:</li>
</ol>

<p>DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/R/R-3.6.2/</p>

<p>and choose <strong>Select Folder.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>You’ll be given a choice between 32 bit and 64 bit; either should work, but 64 bit
is likely to be what your computer is capable of.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the Start folder’s shortcut doesn’t work for you in QGIS, and you get an error message about a 
missing DLL, there’s a location mismatch to resolve. Ask a class helper for assistance 
in switching the .env file that you’re using.</p>
