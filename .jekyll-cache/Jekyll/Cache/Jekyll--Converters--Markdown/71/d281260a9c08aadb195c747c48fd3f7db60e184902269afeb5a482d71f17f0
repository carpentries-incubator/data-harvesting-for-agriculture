  <p>Spatial data can be stored in many different ways, and an important part of using your farm‚Äôs data will involve understanding what format your data is already in and what format another program needs it to be in. During the course of this lesson, we‚Äôll learn:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How to identify which coordinate reference system (CRS) a data file is using</li>
    <li>How, when, and why to transform data from the WGS84 standard to the UTM standard (or vice versa)</li>
    <li>How to save the transformed data as a new file</li>
    <li>Some ways of creating visualizations from your data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="what-is-a-crs">What is a CRS?</h2>

  <p>Geospatial data has a coordinate reference system (CRS) that reports how the map is projected and what point is used as a reference. A projection is a way of making the earth‚Äôs curved surface fit into something you can represent on a flat computer screen. The point used for reference during projection is called a datum.</p>

  <h2 id="importance-of-projections">Importance of Projections</h2>
  <p>To understand why projection matters, take a look at the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection#/media/File:Mercator_projection_Square.JPG">the Mercator projection</a> of the world and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggs_eumorphic_projection#/media/File:Boggs_eumorphic_projection_SW.JPG">Boggs eumorphic projection</a>.</p>

  <p>In the Mercator projection, space that doesn‚Äôt exist is created to make a ‚Äúflat‚Äù map and Greenland and Antarctica disproportionately huge. In the Boggs projection, strategic slices are cut out of the ocean so that the sizes appear a bit closer to true, but Canada and Russia get pinched and Greenland gets bisected. There will always be some compromises made in a projection system that converts curved surfaces to flat ones for the same reason that it‚Äôs difficult to make an orange peel lie flat. So the method you select will have an effect on your outcome.</p>

  <h2 id="understanding-file-types-and-crs-types">Understanding file types and CRS types</h2>

  <p>Geospatial data files have several potential variations, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Vector or raster data</strong>: Whether the information is stored as lines and curves (vector) or as individual dots (raster or bitmap).</li>
    <li><strong>File types</strong>: Several different shape files or one unified geopackage file</li>
    <li><strong>Coordinate reference systems (CRSes)</strong>: Latitude/longitude (WGS84, measured in degrees) or UTM (measured as a distance from a fixed point in meters)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Any of this information can come in any combination ‚Äì you can have vector or raster data in any CRS in either a geopackage file or a collection of shape files. 
<img src="../figure/geo_spatial_figs/image24.png" width="50%" /></p>

  <p>The image on the left below is a vector-based representation of GIS data, with lines and curves; the image on the right is a raster-based representation, with individual values assigned to particular locations in a grid.
<img src="../figure/geo_spatial_figs/image27.png" width="50%" /></p>

  <p>In order to make data from different sources work together, you‚Äôll need to be able to identify what type of data in what CRS you have and how to convert them to the same type of thing ‚Äì making sure you‚Äôre comparing apples to apples.</p>

  <p>For example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The data coming from your equipment will probably be in separate <strong>shape files</strong>. This allows the steering system to work with one file, the planting system to track rates in another file, and so forth. It‚Äôs like giving a group of reporters their own notebooks, instead of asking them all to share the same notebook at the same time.</li>
    <li>However, once the data has been collected, it‚Äôs easier for us to combine those reporters‚Äô notebooks into one <strong>geopackage</strong> file so that the data is all in one place for us to work with at the same time.</li>
    <li>Data coming from your equipment will also likely be reported in a CRS based on <strong>latitude/longitude (WGS84)</strong>, but in order to do calculations based on distance within a field, we‚Äôll want to convert to UTM.</li>
    <li>Because each equipment manufacturer has their own standards, there may be some additional manipulation needed to get from the manufacturer‚Äôs possibly proprietary standard to something that you can use yourself. (This is one reason it‚Äôs helpful to provide us with data before class begins, so that we can help work out the pattern for decoding your equipment manufacturer‚Äôs data before the workshop starts.)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="reading-in-the-boundary-file">Reading in the Boundary File</h2>

  <p>Before we can look at a CRS in R, we need to have a geospatial file in the R environment. We will bring in the field boundary. Use the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_sf()</code> to bring the dataset into your R environment. Because we have already set the working directory for this file, we don‚Äôt need to give the whole path, just the folder data that the gpkg file is stored within.</p>

  <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">boundary</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">read_sf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"data/boundary.gpkg"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>There are many functions for reading files into the environment, but <code class="highlighter-rouge">read_sf()</code> creates an object of class <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">sf</code></strong> or <strong>simple feature.</strong> This class makes accessing spatial data much easier. Much like a data frame, you can access variables within an <code class="highlighter-rouge">sf</code> object using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">$</code> operator. For this and other reasons like the number of spatial calculations available for <code class="highlighter-rouge">sf</code> objects, this class is perferred in most situations.</p>

<blockquote class="textchunk">
  <h2 id="check-the-coordinate-reference-system">Check the coordinate reference system</h2>

  <p>The function for retreiving the CRS of a simple feature is <code class="highlighter-rouge">st_crs().</code> Generally it is good practice to know the CRS of your files, but before combining files and performing operations on geospatial data, it is particularly important. Some commands will not work if the data is in the wrong CRS or if two dataframes are in different CRSs.</p>

  <h2 id="utm-zones">UTM Zones</h2>

  <p>Some coordinate reference systems, such as UTM zones, are measured in meters. Latitude and longitude represent a different type of CRS, defined in terms of angles across a sphere. If we want to create measures of distance, we need the trial design in UTM. But there are many UTM zones, so we must determine the zone of the trial area.</p>

  <p>The UTM system divides the surface of Earth between 80¬∞S and 84¬∞N latitude into 60 zones, each 6¬∞ of longitude in width. Zone 1 covers longitude 180¬∞ to 174¬∞ W; zone numbering increases eastward to zone 60 that covers longitude 174 to 180 East.</p>

<blockquote class="textchunk">
  <h3 id="st_transform-and-espg-codes">st_transform and ESPG Codes</h3>

  <p>For reprojecting spatial data, the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">st_transform()</code> uses an ESPG code to transform a simple feature to the new CRS. EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is a public registry of spatial reference systems, Earth ellipsoids, coordinate transformations and related units of measurement. The ESPG is one way to assign or transform the CRS in R.</p>

  <p>The ESPG for UTM always begins with ‚Äú326‚Äù and the last numbers are the number of the zone. The ESPG for WGS84 is 4326. This is the projection your equipment reads, so any trial design files will need to be transformed back into WGS84 before you implement the trial. Also, all files from your machinery, such as yield, as-applied, and as-planted, will be reported in latitude and longitude with WGS84.</p>

  <h2 id="gpkg-vs-shp-files">.gpkg vs. .shp files</h2>
  <p>You can save the file as a .gpkg or .shp file. The advantage of a .gpkg file is that you only save one file rather than four files in a shapefile. Because shapefiles contain multiple files, they can be corrupted if one piece is missing. One example is a .prj file. If the .prj file is missing, the shapefile will have no CRS, and you will need to determine the CRS of the object. You will often need to transform a file from UTM to lat/long and save the new file during trial design, so this is an important step. One common problem with these files is that when you try to open a .gpkg file for the first time in R, it might not work if you haven‚Äôt opened it in QGIS before.</p>
