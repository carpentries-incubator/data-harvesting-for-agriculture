<p>Put together, there are about 4 to 5 Gb of software and data to install.
This takes some time over most home network connections, so we are creating installed USB drives 
that you can copy from.</p>

<p><strong>If you want to take the software with you, we recommend that you copy it to your
computer‚Äôs C drive. The Center for Digital Agriculture needs the USB drives back
at the end of the workshop.</strong></p>

<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate programs. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. Once installed, because RStudio is an IDE, RStudio will run R 
in the background.  You do not need to run it separately.</p>

<h2 id="mac-you-can-install-from-the-usb-drives-to-save-download-time">Mac: You can install from the USB drives to save download time</h2>
<p>Macs won‚Äôt allow you to run software from a USB drive the way Windows will, but we‚Äôve copied the installation files here to save you the downloading time.</p>

<p>The Mac installation time should be much faster than what we‚Äôve experienced on the Windows side, and anticipate it would be around 20 minutes.</p>

<p>For Macs, you can follow the instructions at <a href="https://data-carpentry-for-agriculture.github.io/trial-lesson/10-Installing-R-on-Mac/index.html">‚ÄúInstalling R and R Studio on a Mac‚Äù</a>, but instead of downloading from the Internet, look in the DataHarvestingMac folder for your files.</p>

<h2 id="windows-usb-based-options">Windows: USB-based options</h2>

<p>The Windows manual installation process has taken 3-4 hours to complete in our test runs, so we have two much-faster options available for you based on our USB drives which should only take about 10-20 minutes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to keep the software and have about 5 Gb space free, at the workshop you can copy it from the USB stick to your computer‚Äôs C drive.</li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt have about 5 Gb of space free, you can run the software directly on the USB drive. (However, we‚Äôll need the USB sticks back at the end of the workshop.)</li>
  <li>If you don‚Äôt want to wait for the workshop and want to download and install before you arrive, see ‚ÄúManual installation in advance‚Äù below.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-the-start-menu-folder-for-where-you-want-to-use-it">Use the ‚Äústart menu‚Äù folder for where you want to use it</h3>
<p>When these USB drives were created, they were assigned the letter D on a Windows computer.
However, if you copy to your own computer‚Äôs hard drive, that will probably be C.</p>

<p>On Windows, you can skip the 5 Gb download process by copying the DataHarvestingWin folder
to the root level of your C drive and running it from  there. (Your new path should be
C:\DataHarvestingWin\ as opposed to the old path of D:\DataHarvestingWin.)</p>

<h3 id="launching-the-programs">Launching the programs</h3>
<p>Within DataHarvestingWin, the <strong>folders with Start Menu in their names</strong> contain shortcuts
to run the software.</p>

<p>Choose the version that corresponds to the drive you‚Äôre planning to run it from ‚Äì
C if you copy the folders to your own computer, and probably D if you run from the USB
drive.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôre running from USB but it wasn‚Äôt assigned the letter D, find:</p>

<p>DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/RStudio/bin/rstudio.exe</p>

<p>and double-click it to run.</p>

<p>The first time you run R Studio, you‚Äôll be prompted to select your installation of R.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the <strong>‚ÄúChoose a specific version of R‚Äù</strong> item next to the large text box.</li>
  <li>Use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate to:</li>
</ol>

<p>DataHarvestingWin/ProgramFiles/R/R-3.6.2/</p>

<p>and choose <strong>Select Folder.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>You‚Äôll be given a choice between 32 bit and 64 bit; either should work, but 64 bit
is likely to be what your computer is capable of.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the Start folder‚Äôs shortcut doesn‚Äôt work for you in QGIS, and you get an error message about a 
missing DLL, there‚Äôs a location mismatch to resolve. Ask a class helper for assistance 
in switching the .env file that you‚Äôre using.</p>
