## Glossary

{:auto_ids}

argument
:   A value given to a function or program when it runs. The term is often used interchangeably
(and inconsistently) with [parameter](#parameter).

comma-separated values (CSV)
:   A common textual representation for tables in which the values in each row are separated by commas.

comment
:   A remark in a program that is intended to help human readers understand what is going on, but is
ignored by the computer. Comments in Python, R, and the Unix shell start with a `#` character and run
to the end of the line; comments in SQL start with `--`, and other languages have other conventions.

data
:   Quantities on which R will perform calculations.

data type
:   The format of the data you are working with.  For whole numbers (e.g. -5, 1, 2) these are called `integers`, for numbers with decimals these are called `floats`, for words or phrases (e.g. "hi", "Hi all!") these are called strings.

dimensions (of an array)
:   An array's extent, represented as a vector. For example, an array with 5 rows and 3 columns has
dimensions `(5,3)`.

documentation
:   Human-language text written to explain what software does, how it works, or how to use it.

encapsulation
:   The practice of hiding something's implementation details so that the rest of a program can
worry about *what* it does rather than *how* it does it.

function
:   A piece of code that we want to use again and again.

function body
:   The statements that are executed inside a function.

function call
:   A use of a function in another piece of software.

function composition
:   The immediate application of one function to the result of another, such as `f(g(x))`.

index
:   A subscript that specifies the location of a single value in a collection, such as a single
pixel in an image.

parameter
:   A variable named in the function's declaration that is used to hold a value passed into the call.
The term is often used interchangeably (and inconsistently) with [argument](#argument).

variable
:   R variables are of an R object type and are mostly lists of data and can be numeric or text

working directory
:   The file path on your computer that sets the default location of any files you read into R, or save out of R.
