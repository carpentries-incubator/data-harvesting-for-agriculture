06/02/2014 00:00:00,Map unit description,map unit concept,,"Croatan muck, ponded, 0 to 2 percent slopes   (DMU ID 703736)
The concept for this Croatan MLRA mapunit is: Croatan soils with a muck surface, frequently ponded with a very long duration, 0 to 2 percent slopes, non-flooding, and undrained.

 This map unit was created to combine concepts and map units from 13 NC Coastal Plain counties in MLRA 153A. The new DMU was copied and edited from the original DMU MLRA153A Croatan mk, 0-1% (Rec ID 456633) and links it and two other Croatan DMUs (Rec IDs 530054 and 473951) into the one. The Component Pedon for the new DMU is from the TUD in Jones County (NC103) which is also the Croatan OSD and Jones Co. is one of the counties evaluated in this DMU concept. 3-RIC SSA also has a similar Croatan MU/DMU for MLRA 153A.
 
 There are a few outlyers of Croatan mapunit polygons in Columbus (NC047) and Bladen (NC017) counties that are in MLRA 133A (Southern Coastal Plain). Because of the minimum of acres these mapunit polygons are included in this SDJR mapunit project and no spatial edits are needed at this time.
 
 Croatan soils in this MLRA map unit are very poorly drained organic soils that formed in highly decomposed organic material commonly 41 to 89 cm (16 to 35 inches) thick but ranging to 130 cm (51 inches) and underlain by loamy textured marine and fluvial sediment. The organic material was derived from herbaceous plants and may contain up to 10 percent logs, stumps and other wood fragments. Runoff is very slow to ponded. Permeability is slow to moderately rapid. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. This map unit is scattered throughout the coastal plain, predominately on broad, flat interstream divides, pocosins, in Carolina bays, and upland depressions.  In two counties, it was described to occur on low stream terraces and floodplains.  In areas where they occur on stream terraces and floodplains, flooding may occur.  Ponding occurs on all units of Croatan, except where drained, and persists for very long durations.  Large areas of these Croatan soils occur in the Green Swamp of Columbus and Brunswick Counties, Angola Bay area in north Pender and south Duplin Counties, Holly Shelter area of Pender County, Hoffman Forest area of south Jones and north Onslow Counties; and in the Croatan National Forest in Jones, Craven, and Carteret Counties. Included soils make up between 10 and 25 percent of the map unit.  Much of the acreage is wooded and supports plant communities that reflect past history of treatment. Native vegetation consists of scattered pond pine with a dense understory of titi, gallberry, huckleberry, southern bayberry, greenbrier, sphagnum moss, redbay, sweetbay, switchcane, and giant cane. Croatan soils also support mixed hardwoods, mainly water and swamp tupelo, southern baldcypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and other hyperphytic species. This unit is used predominately for native woodland and timber plantations.  A small percentage is used for agricultural production.  
 
Slope: 4 of 9 counties used <2% slopes, 3 of 9 used 0-2% slopes, 1 of 9 used 0-1% slopes, and 1 of 9 used <1% slopes. I decided to use 0 to 2 percent slopes to be all inclusive of the slope ranges represented in the counties that were evaluated.
 
Most county manuscripts did not address the drained component of Croatan mapunits. Croatan DMUs in NASIS only have the drained and undrained components and do not have other named components. The project leader for this new MLRA DMU has only the undrained component of Croatan and 2 other named components.

Included soils: 
 Torhunta-mineral
 Lynn Haven-mineral, spodisol
 Leon-mineral, spodisol
 Pamlico-thinner OM, sandy mineral
 Wasda-thinner OM
 Johnston-mucky mineral, floodplain
 Paxville-mineral
 Pantego-mineral
 Murville-sandy mineral, spodisol
 Dare-thicker OM
 Pocomoke-mineral
 Portsmouth-mineral
 Rutlege-mineral
 Bayboro-mineral
 Dorovan-floodplain
 
 Torhunta and Pantego soils were the most commonly named dissimilar inclusions listed and were used as the named DMU components. Torhunta and Pantego soils are both very poorly drained. Torhunta is coarse-loamy and Pantego is fine-loamy and both mostly occur along edges of large Croatan delineations where the organic soils are transitioning back to mineral soils.

Future projects: Croatan soils need to be documented with pedon descriptions and transects. Most Croatan delineations are hard to access because of the dense vegetation but in some places access is available where there are research areas as in Hoffman Forest, or Wildlife Resources Commission Game Lands, and various paper company lands. Because of current land use for most of this mapunit I catagorize this as low priority for future projects. Sample collection for full characterization should be done for the OSD site in Jones County, (NC103).

10/07/2014 00:00:00,Map unit description,map unit concept,,"The MLRA 153A (and 133A) Goldsboro fine sandy loam, 0-2% slopes map unit consists of moderately well drained soils with a seasonal high water table between 24 to 36 inches (61-91 cm)

These map units are found on broad, smooth, slightly convex landscapes, often near drainageways in the upper and middle coastal plain. These soils are formed from loamy marine/fluviomarine deposits of the pleistocene era. Landscape position is most often broad flat ridges on interstream divides. Minor soil inclusions are most often Norfolk, Lynchburg and Rains, Foreston, Onslow and Exum. Norfolk is most often found on slightly higher parts of the landscape. Lynchburg and Rains are on slighly lower landscapes and depressions. Foreston, Exum and Onslow occupy similar landscape positons. Foreston is coarser textured, Exum is fine-silty, while Onslow exhibits a Bh horizon.

Goldsboro often patterns in a catena with Norfolk, Lynchburg and Rains, fitting in between Norfolk and Lynchburg in drainage.  Sometimes other soils such as Noboco or other sandier, well drained or excessively well drained soils take the place of Norfolk.  The better drained soils such as Norfolk and Goldsboro are usually found closer to drainage ways, while poorer drained soils exist on the broader, flat landscapes furtherist away from the drainage ways. 
Goldsboros concept is very similar or the same throughout most of the Coastal Plain.  The vast majority of the Coastal Plain was mapped during the period of the early 70s to the mid 80s.  Most of the soil scientist who mapped the Coastal Plain worked under and were trained by Leslie Barnhill.  These soil scientist carried his mapping concepts from one county to the next.   Of those few soil scientist still working, it has been over 25 years since they worked the coastal plain.  This lack of variation of mapping concepts can easily be seen in the individual soil survey manuals.


The Goldsboro component make up about 85 percent of the unit.  Norfolk consists of about 8 persent while Lynchburg is about 7 percent.  The seasonal high water table is usually between 2 and 3 feet.  However, direct observation during the growing season has shown that the water table can be much deeper, and perhaps not within 203 cm at times. Elevation ranges are from near sealevel to about 40 meters. The average slope is about 1 percent, but included are some areas of greater than 2 percent that are of minor extent. Goldsboro soils in these areas are used mainly for cropland, with the remainder mostly used for forest production.The size of the map units range from 15 acres up to 250 acres, depending upon topography. 

The decison to combined all the fine sandy loam Goldsboro counties makes good sense. All the counties are coastal, or near coastal and are adjacent to each other.  The only county contrary is New Hanover, which was not done to modern standards. Horry County SC, or at least part of it, should also be suspect for fine sandy loam surfaces. These two counties would be prime targets for future projects in this regard. The latest legend (2/2007)for Duplin County suggests a Goldsboro fsl, 0-2% unit, which should be included in this project. However, the NASIS data and GIS data for Duplin County currently has all the Goldsboro as a loamy sand surface texture.  Therefore the Goldsboro map units in Duplin county are currently being accounted for in SDJR - MLRA 133A - 153A - 3-NEW Goldsboro loamy sand, 0 to 2 percent slopes.  For this reason, Duplin County has been excluded from this project, at this time.
Also of note is the the fact that New Hanover County is situated directly between two counties in this project. However, New Hanover County is an old survey, not to modern standards and was slated for an update before NRCS re-organized. The New Hanover soil survey did not use Goldsboro in any form. Any update or re-correlation of this survey would most likely include a Goldsboro unit that would fit this project.

Future Projects should probably focus in on two areas.  The soil itself, is fairly well documented.  The only lacking is probably actual water table studies, which I would deem low priority. First priority is general data collection. Many of the surveys were not documented to modern standards with descriptions and transects. For the ones that were, that documentation has been lost or destroyed.  The collection of this data will lead and answer the second Future Project concern, which it what surface textures are found where, and should the fsl surface texture be expanded into additonal counties. This will require sampling and PSA not only from the counties in this Project, but surrounding suspect counties as well.
In additon, the aforementioned Duplin County survey completion, and an update/re-correlation of the New Hanover soil survey may add additional acres to this project.

Goldsboro is one of the most common as well as abundant acreages of map units to be found in the upper and middle coastal plain, from Virginia to Florida and as far west as Mississippi and Arkansas.

There was very little change to no changes made in the stored interps.  The Kw and Kf only changed slightly during calculation.

Lab data is available from the Lincoln Lab Data site for Sampson County NC,(not in this project) and 5 more counties outside MSSO 3-New.

07/17/2015 00:00:00,Map unit description,map unit concept,,"153A Map Unit Concept
The MLRA 153A Lynchburg fine sandy loam, 0-2% slopes map unit consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that occur in the upper and middle coastal plain. For MLRA 153A, these counties include Brunswick, New Hanover, Onslow, Jones, Craven, and Pitt. 

These map units are found on broad, smooth interstream divides, slightly convex landscapes, often near drainageways in the upper and middle coastal plain. The larger units are more often found on the smooth interstream divides, while the smaller units are more often located in depressions on slightly convex landscapes. These soils are formed from loamy marine/fluviomarine deposits of the pleistocene era. It is most often found on broad flat ridges throughout the coastal plain. Minor soil inclusions are most often Rains, Goldsboro and Stallings. Other inclusions are Onslow, Nahunta, and Coxville. Goldsboro and Onslow are slightly better drained and usually found on slightly higher landscape positions, while Rains and Coxville are poorly drained and usually found on lower positions, often in swales or depressions. Stallings and Nahunta are found on similar landscape positions as Lynchburg at random, but Stallings is coarser textured and Nahunta is fine-silty.

The majority of this map unit occurs in the middle coastal plain, where sediments are of the Pliocene and Pleistocene age, that derive loamy textures for this map unit.  
Diagnostic horizons often present are Ochric, and Argillic.  Aquic Conditons are also present.  The horizonation can be variable.  Many pedons exhibit an ""E"" horizon, but it is not uncommon for an ""E"" horizon to be absent.  A ""Bt"" horizon is often the same.  It may or may not be present. As noted in the inclusions, other surface textures can occur other than fine sandy loam.  For many soils, it appears that soil surface textures may have some correlation to the MLRA lines. Only additional data collection bearing this thought in mind will confirm or negate this theory.                                                                

The Lynchburg component make up about 82 percent of the unit.  Rains consists of about 9 percent while Goldsboro is about 8 percent.  The seasonal high water table is usually between .5 (15cm) and 1.5 feet (46 cm).  However, direct observation during the growing season has shown that the water table can be much deeper. Elevation ranges are from near sea level to about 100 ft. (30 meters). The average slope is about 1 percent, but included are some areas of greater than 2 percent that are of minor extent. Lynchburg soils in these counties, as a whole, are used mainly for cropland, with the remainder mostly used for forest production, but individual counties may vary widely.  The size of the map units range from 4 acres up to 500 acres, depending upon topography. 

The decision to combine all the fine sandy loam Lynchburg counties makes good sense. The map unit is basically found in two clusters of counties, separated by only one county (Pender).  Pender County would be prime targets for future projects in this regard.  Although this unit seems to be more predominate in MLRA 153A, there is a significant portion found in MLRA 133A in Halifax, Edgecombe, Pitt, Bladen and Columbus.  

Future Projects should probably focus in on two areas.  The soil itself, is fairly well documented.  The only lacking is probably actual water table studies, which I would deem low priority. First priority is general data collection. Transects, Descriptions and Lab Samples. Many of the surveys were not documented to modern standards with descriptions and transects. For the ones that were, that documentation has been lost or destroyed.  The collection of this data will lead and answer the second Future Project concern, which it what surface textures are found where, and should the fsl surface texture be expanded into additional counties, such as Pender, where there is a gap in continuity. This will require sampling and PSA not only from the counties in this Project, but surrounding suspect counties as well. Also, the Evaluation revealed that Duplin has coorelated all its Lynchburg fsl acreage (19,000+ acres) to Goldsboro and taken Lynchburg out of the legend.  I am extremely skeptical of this decision, especially after looking over the most current data (2007) by Lee Mallard, located at the 3-NEW office.

Lynchburg is one of the most common as well as abundant acreages of map units to be found in the upper and middle coastal plain.
There was very little change to no changes made in the stored interps.  The Kw and Kf only changed slightly during calculation.

Lab data is not available from the Lincoln Lab Data site for any of the counties in this project.

The seasonal high water table is 0 to 12 inches (0 to 30 cm). It is found on nearly level broad flats on interstream divides (interfluves), and shallow depressions on slightly convex interstream divides on uplands in the Atlantic Flatwoods of the lower coastal plain. Larger units up to 2,000 acres in size can be found on the nearly level, broad flats, while the convex divides holds map units of 50 acres or less.  Elevations range from near sea level, to 51 meters (167ft.) 
Based on the percent of inclusions, (several counties give inclusions in a range such as 10% to 15%) the Rains component makes up between 83.5 and 86.5 percent of the map unit, and the units occur randomly and are wide spread throughout not only MLRA 153A, but MLRA 133A as well (with different percentages and inclusions).  For this Project, a figure of 85% will be used. In counties that share a portion of the Tidewater (153B) MLRA, Rains does not appear to cross over into it. Rains appears on the Talbot and Micomico escarpment surfaces of MLRA 153A, but is absent on the Pamlico surfaces of 153B. 
Most surveys state that the undrained map unit, used almost exclusively for woodland, is the predominate use. Rarely is over half the acreage in a county drained and used for cropland. Gates county is the only exception, where cropland acreage trumps woodland acreage for this map unit.  It is important to note, that although the undrained map units are more predominate, their use is restricted almost exclusively for woodland. Under normal circumstances, this would be the only phase of the map unit presented in a project.  However, the drained acreage is used for multiple purposes, and is the map unit clients would more often request soils information for. Therefore both phases are presented in this Project.

There is very little variation in mapping concepts throughout the coastal plain on these units. The vast majority of soil scientist working in the coastal plain were influenced by veteran soil scientist Leslie Barnhill, who either trained or supervised most of the other soil scientists at one time or another. His concepts of coastal plain mapping were perpetuated throughout the coastal plain by his ""students"".

Aside from New Hanover county in NC that is a taxijunct that affects use and management, all Rains map units with a fine sandy loam surfaces were combined. The only major differenes, of minor extent, were that of a few odd inclusions, and acreage of cropland vs. woodland. 

Future needs:

Study on the flooding in NC129 (New Hanover)on Rains fsl units.  This is the only survey that states this map unit floods, therefore, it was evaluated but left out of this project (for now) for this reason.  Several others mention ponding, mostly in lower lying areas, but no flood.  It is my suspicion that the ""flooding"" in New Hanover County is actually ""ponding"", and that ponding is occuring in urban areas where impervious surfaces run the water off into the lower lying areas occupied by Rains soils. Also of note, is that New Hanover County is also one of the older surveys in the coastal plain and was slated for an update before re-organization of NRCS pre-empted it. Because of this, many concepts and soil types may be in need of change in New Hanover County.

This MU needs transect data, profile descriptions, and lab samples to verify MU composition and soil properties. Sampling and lab analysis are needed across the distribution of the MU within the MLRA.

Ecological site data will also be needed for the Rains map units.

Spatial joins will need to be assessed and completed. Joins from on county to the next may be necessary that connects similar map units that are not exact matches (i.e. rains fsl to rains sl, l, etc). These situation may have to be resolved by making an exact match.

06/10/2009 00:00:00,Nontechnical description,Cropland,new,"This map unit consists of nearly level Torhunta soils on upland flats and in depressions. Torhunta soils are very deep and very poorly drained. They have a loamy surface layer with a high content of organic matter, and a loamy and sandy subsoil. Seasonal high water table is within a depth of 1.0 foot.

Cropland
Suitability: Suited
Management concerns: Wetness, trafficability and moderately rapid permeability
Management measures and considerations:
The seasonal high water table restricts equipment operation, decreases the viability of crops, and interferes with the planting and harvesting of crops.
Management of surface water helps to reduce the wetness limitation and improve soil productivity.
Excessive permeability increases the risk of ground-water contamination.
Applying lime and fertilizer according to recommendations based on soil tests helps to increase the availability of plant nutrients and maximize crop productivity.
These soils may retain soil-applied herbicides and other pesticides due to the high content of organic matter in the surface layer. The concentration of pesticides may be damaging to future crops. Using pesticides that are applied to the plant rather than the soil may increase their effectiveness.
Federal and State regulations protecting wetlands may restrict the use of drainage systems and other alterations to areas of Torhunta soils.

Seasonal high water table is within a depth of 1.0 foot.

Pasture and hayland
Suitability: Poorly suited
Management concerns: Trafficability and wetness
Management measures and considerations:
The seasonal high water table can affect equipment use, grazing patterns, and viability of grass and legume species.
Preventing overgrazing or preventing grazing when the soil is too wet helps to prevent soil compaction, decreased productivity, and a rough soil surface.
Hayland and pasture should be managed for forage species that are tolerant of excessive wetness.
Federal and State regulations protecting wetlands may restrict the use of drainage systems and other alterations to areas of Torhunta soils.
Applying lime and fertilizer according to recommendations based on soil tests helps to increase the availability of plant nutrients and maximizes productivity when establishing, maintaining, or renovating hayland and pasture.
