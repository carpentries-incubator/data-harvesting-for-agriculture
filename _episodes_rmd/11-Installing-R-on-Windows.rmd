title: "Installing R and RStudio on Windows"
questions:
- Do I want to install the software before the workshop?
- Can I download 5 Gb of installation files and data files over my network?
- Am I comfortable with running package installation scripts in R Studio?
objectives:
- If you'd like an instructor's assistance, we recommend you wait until the workshop.
- If you'd like to experiment on your own, you can follow these instructions.

## If you choose to install before the workshop begins

If you're installing R, R Studio, and QGIS before the workshop begins, you can follow these
instructions instead of the USB instructions. (All the steps below have been taken on the USB drives.)

### Before you start

Check that you have about 5 Gb of free space on your computer's hard drive. On Windows 10, you can open File Manager and click This PC for a look at your drive space.

### R and R Studio

You'll need to install R before R Studio, and after you've installed R Studio you'll need to run some manual package installation and library loading scripts. We'll start with R.


* Download R from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* In the command line window that launches, you should see some R descriptive text and a ">" symbol. 
* You can do some simple math on the command line (such as 5+12) to make sure it's fully loaded and responding.

Next:

* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  Vista/7/8/10** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

### Installing the geospatial and federal data packages
  
* When RStudio is open and working, create a new R script file and copy in the 
contents of [this installation script file](https://github.com/data-carpentry-for-agriculture/trial-lesson/blob/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/package_install_script.R). 

Here's where to make a new script:

<img src="../fig/wininstall4-rstudioinstallscript1.png">

* Run each line in this script by selecting it and clicking Run. 
* Watch for any error messages along the way.
* If the red stop sign in the top right corner of the console is still highlighted and the curosr is a gray |, an installation process is still running.
* If you see a blue > in the console , you're ready to run the next line.
(Note that this process can take **3 - 4 hours on Windows 10** because of virus checking procedures
that were already taken care of on the USB sticks. If you can wait for the USB sticks, you'll have
a faster way to get up and running.)

### Checking that the packages installed correctly

* After you've run the installation items, create a new R script file and copy in the 
contents of [the package load and test file](https://github.com/data-carpentry-for-agriculture/trial-lesson/blob/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/package_load_and_test.R). 
* Run each line by selecting it and clicking the Run key. Each test should let you know whether an error was encountered in the loading process.

## Before you start

1. Check which version of Mac OS you have. To do this, click on the Apple icon on the top-left of your screen, then click "About This Mac". A little window should pop up with version information.

<img src="../fig/which_mac_version.png" width="50%">  


2. Make sure that you have about 500 MB of free space on your machine. We will need this space to install both R and RStudio, and when the program installs the compressed files expand to take much more space.  

## Installing R

1. Go to [this website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/).

2. If your mac is OS X 10.11 and higher (this should be the case for most of you), click the `R-3.6.2.pkg` link. If your mac is OS X 10.9 or 10.10, click the `R-3.3.3.pkg` link.  

3. After clicking on the link, the file (package installer) will be downloaded onto your computer. Once the file has been downloaded, click on the `.pkg` file that downloads in your default Download folder and walk through the installation process. Accept the default options for now.

R is now **installed** on your computer.  

### Testing R

1. Double-click on the R icon in the Applications folder:

<img src="../fig/applications_folder_r.png" width="50%">

A window titled "R Console" should pop up:

<img src="../fig/R_Console.png" width="40%">  
\
The `>` character is called the prompt and is the place where we enter commands for the program to interpret. For instance, if you type `25+5` followed by the return/enter key, you will see:

```{r}
25+5
```

<img src="../fig/R_console_using.png" width="50%">

2. To quit R, call the quit function by going to `File -> Quit R`.


R will ask you if you want to save your work:

<img src="../fig/closing_r_dontSAve.png" width="50%">
\
Click on "Don't Save". You have now left R.  

We are not going to use R this way often, as we will use an integrated environment called RStudio.  

## Installing RStudio

1. Go to [this website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

2. Click on the `Free` link (note: there are paid options, but we won't be using those!). The file download will begin.
  * If you have an older computer, you *may* have to find your installer on [this page](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206569407-Older-Versions-of-RStudio), but feel free to contact us about that!

3. Once the file has been downloaded, click on it. A window should pop up:

<img src="../fig/Rstudio_download.png" width="50%">
\
Click on the RStudio icon and drag it into the Applications folder. 

RStudio is now **installed** on your computer.

**Note**: For RStudio to work, R needs to be installed first.

### Testing RStudio

1. Double-click on the RStudio icon in the Applications:

<img src="../fig/applications_folder.png" width="50%">  

A window titled "RStudio" should pop up, looking something like this:

<img src="../fig/rstudio_opened.png" width="75%">

2. Just as in R, the `>` character in the Console window is where we enter commands for the program to interpret.  You can try entering something there and then hitting the `Enter` key to see:

```{r}
25+5
```


3. To exit RStudio, click "RStudio" in the menu bar, then click "Quit RStudio". Alternatively, use the `Cmd-Q` shortcut. If prompted to save the workspace, do not save it.
