# Programming concepts and language

Programming doesn’t have to be scary, and we have some real-world examples to help you understand what’s going on with these words we’re typing in a window. The words in bold will come up in a programming context later on, but it might help to have a mental reference picture to associate with these words.

Let’s imagine that instead of a program to work with numbers and letters, we’re creating a program that cooks breakfast instead.

In order to make breakfast, you need:
 * A **working directory** (the place where you’re doing things, such as your kitchen countertop)
 * Available **data** (information about what you’re working with)
     * Data could be an inventory of your pantry, a grocery shopping list, a map of the store, a collection of prices at the store, and so forth.
 * **Types** of **objects** -- a method of grouping what can be done to what types of things.
     * Food is one type of thing; people are another; pets are a third.
     * A specific food object can be an egg or a pancake; a particular pet object can be your cat or your dog.
 * Some **inputs** that may be **objects** of appropriate **types** (breakfast food ingredients)
     * You create breakfast by performing actions on objects of food types, and then you feed it to things of the people and pet types.
 * Some **functions** (recipes that work with the ingredients)
     * Inputs to functions are usually stored in **variables** -- you don’t always want to make the same thing every day, so the instructions have placeholder names for things that are similar to each other but may vary. (A “todays_cheese” variable could hold Stilton for one day’s omelet and cheddar for the next.)
 * You need to match your **object** types to your **functions**.
     * You shouldn’t use a pet-type object as an input to a breakfast-making function. (Nobody wants to eat the goldfish for breakfast.)
     * You might be able to use a dinner-type food object as an input to a breakfast-making function, but use caution.
 * Some **outputs** (food ready to be consumed) 
 * A **destination** (where to put the food that’s ready to be consumed)
     * You could put your outputs in your working directory (eat breakfast in your kitchen) or you could send it to another location (put leftovers in the refrigerator)
