title: "Introduction to Geospatial Data"
questions:
- "What are the types of spatially-referenced data that I might encounter in agriculture?"
- "How can I work with geospatial data in R and QGIS?"
objectives:
- "Determine whether data are stored in vector or raster format"
- "Identify the coordinate system for a dataset"
- "Talk about when data don't have a projection defined (missing .prj file)"
- "Determine UTM zone of a dataset" 
- "Reproject the dataset into UTM"
- "Import geospatial files into your R environment"
- "Visualize geospatial data with R"
- "Create geospatial files from lat/long coordinates"
- "Create an ab-line"
- "Know when to use a simple feature and when to use a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"
keypoints:
- "sf is prefereable for data analysis; it is easier to access the dataframe"
- "projecting your data in utm is necessary for many of the geometric operations you perform (e.g. making trial grids and splitting plots into subplot data)"
