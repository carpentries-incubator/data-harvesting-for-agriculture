Welcome to Data Carpentry for Agriculture! (or substitute non-Carpentry name here)

By the end of this workshop, you will know more about:
* How to understand more about the data coming from your agricultural equipment
* What you can do with it yourself using free and open source tools
* Where to find historical data relevant to your own farm and/or county's location and land
* How to use both current and historical data about your own farm and/or county to develop custom fertilizing strategies 
that can improve cost effective application in your particular location

To do this, we'll be introducing you to:
* R Studio, free and open source software used for creating both programs and visualizations
* Several data types used by agricultural equipment
(etc, will write more after next meeting)
