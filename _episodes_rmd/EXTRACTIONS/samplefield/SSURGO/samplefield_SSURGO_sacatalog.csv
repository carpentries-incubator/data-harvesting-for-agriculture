This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.
This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.
</abstract><purpose>
SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.
</purpose><supplinf>
Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products
derived from these data.
This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.
Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).
</attraccr></attracc><logic>
Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.
The Soil Survey of (OH033) Crawford County, Ohio is edge matched to all
of the adjacent SSURGO certified soil surveys:
OH077  Huron County, Ohio
OH101  Marion County, Ohio
OH117  Morrow County, Ohio
OH139  Richland County, Ohio
OH147  Seneca County, Ohio
OH175  Wyandot County, Ohio
All feature edges (polygon and line segments) match adjacent ones
in the edge matched survey areas, and all feature labels
match the adjacent feature labels in edge matched surveys.
Descriptive attributes (tabular information about the polygons and
line segments) were developed specifically for each survey area.
The soil survey area boundary for Crawford County matches the soil
survey area boundary for the adjacent certified soil surveys.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
on the map is a delineation.
Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may
not be indicated on the map.
A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
(map unit components), each with a designated range in
proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
or no recognizable soil.
Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
(current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.
The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.
Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.
Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
complex or association is used in the name. The major components
of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
each major component is normally present though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.
Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that are not consistently associated
geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
the same map delineation. These components are included in the
same named map unit because their use and management are the same
or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
undifferentiated groups as to consociations.
Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.
A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 2 acres.

The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map
Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.
For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.

Field procedures for the second order soil survey included plotting of
soil boundaries determined by field observations in conjuction with
aerial photo interpretation. Boundaries were verified at closely spaced
intervals and the soils in each delineation were identified by
traversing and transecting the landscape.  Soil Scientists described and
analyzed the data. The classification and map unit names were finalized
at the final correlation conference in 1975 and signed in 1975. The
published soil survey report was released in 1979.

The soil lines and special features were raster scanned from inked
mylars at 1:15,840 scale.  The soil lines, symbols and special features
were raster scanned from paper map sheets without the photo background
by Draft-co Inc. Martins Ferry, Ohio.  Each photo overlay was then
aligned with its corresponding special features and soil delineation
overlay in the CAD environment.  This align was followed by a digital
orthorectification process (SYRUP- Simple Yet Robust Universal
Parametric-Orthorectification).  Inputs into the model include the
scanned and registered soil delineation overlays, special soil features
overlays, and photo background overlays, as well as standard 1-meter
resolution USGS digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ), and a standard USGS
30-meter, seamless Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
The first step in the SYRUP process is to obtain sufficient ground
control points (GCPs) between each mapsheet overlay and its
corresponding DOQQs.  This is performed using ERDAS Imagine software
(ERDAS, Inc., 2001).  GCPs are recorded in a text file along with their
associated elevation values gathered from the DEM and are input into the
SYRUP model.  The root mean square error (RMSE) of each individual
control point and the average RMSE of all control points were calculated
using X-file and Y-file coordinates, X-ground and Y-ground coordinates,
and Z-elevation values.  The RMSE describes the deviation between the
actual location of a GCP and the value calculated by the transformation
and must be lower than 10.00 for each mapsheet.  The RMSE values were
calculated by the ERDAS Imagine software, based on a two-dimensional
registration, because this was the only type of registration ERDAS
Imagine provides.
Since ultimately a three dimensional registration (SYRUP) was being
applied to the data, a specific RMSE value to be used as a breakpoint
value for quality control purposes was not appropriate in this case.
Rather, relative values were compared and used as an index to flag
certain areas for further spatial examination and GCP adjustment.  A
spatial measurement was used as a rigid indicator of quality control.
This is a measurement of the distance between mapsheet overlay locations
after ortho-rectification and their corresponding actual DOQQ locations.
Distance measurements were examined at extremely large scales (1:1,000
or larger) to assure compliance with minimum USGS National Map Accuracy
Standards (NMAS).  The SYRUP extension to ERDAS Imagine uses a
statistical model involving a statistical approximation to produce a
geometrically correct version of each publication mapsheet overlay.
Resulting images were also visually compared with corresponding DOQQ
images using the Swipe tool in ERDAS Imagine for quality.  Problem areas
in need of increased quality were edited by adding and/or adjusting
control points where needed.  These areas can them be processed through
the SYRUP model once again.   ERDAS Imagine was then used to convert the
raster image (*.img) file format to grid raster file format for viewing
in ARC/INFO.
The raster, soil delineation layer was then converted to a binary,
raster .tif using AutoCAD.  Hitachi software in a CAD environment was
used to convert the binary raster lines into vector lines.  AutoCAD
software was used to clean vector lines and attribute the soil polygons
with their appropriate soil map unit symbols.  The clean lines were then
splined using a quadratic B-spline in AutoCAD software and
generalized using ESRI software.
Bodies of water were aligned to the ortho photo image except for areas
less than 2 acres in size.  Areas less than 2 acres in size were shown
as a point special feature labeled 'WAT'.  Most errors found on the
published soil maps were corrected by a soil scientist who referred to
copies of the original soil survey field sheets.  A few errors were
field checked by soil scientists and corrected.
The orthorectified symbol/feature overlays were used as a background
reference image to determine which map unit symbols were associated with
which soil polygons.  Special soil features were also digitized and
attributed as separate point and line coverages using AutoCAD. Cultural
features are then exported out of AutoCad with the appropriate object
data attached to each feature.
The line work and symbols are processed using a series of queries and
spatial joins in MapInfo. The formed polygons are then returned to
AutoCad and written out as an ARC/INFO coverage for a final product.
Quality assurance/quality control was conducted by the Ohio Department
of Natural Resources.  All Soil Line placements and labels were checked
and verified.  In addition, label placement locations for soil polygons
were moved to the centroid of polygons where possible or to other
locations to prevent the overlap of labels from adjoining polygons and
special features.  ARC/INFO software was used to edge match quarter
quadrangles of soil data which were then merged into a county-wide
layer.  The data were then sent to the Wisconsin Digitizing Unit where
it was processed with the 20040211 Recert AMLs provided by National
Cartographic and Geospatial Center.

The Michigan Digitizing Unit (MIDU) staff downloaded the SSURGO data
for Crawford County and the adjacent surveys from the Soil Data
Warehouse (SDW).  The MIDU staff imported the coverages into a
geodatabase and checked the spatial data with the ARCGIS Version 9.2
software.  To remove excess vertices, the soil boundaries were
generalized at a tolerance of 0.5 meters.  The boundaries of this soil
survey were adjusted to match the boundaries of the adjacent soil
surveys at a tolerance of 0.1 meters.  After the soil survey was
edited, the area, line and point feature classes were converted to
ARC/INFO coverages and exported as e00 files.  The digital maps of the
mapping units and the special soil features were imported into the
ARC/INFO Version 7.2.1 software for review and certification.  The
MIDU staff checked the data with a set of ARC Macro Language (AML)
programs developed by the NCGC.  The seamless coverages were checked
using the January 2006 SSURGO Evaluation AML programs.  The labels in
the spatial data matched the symbols in the mapunit table from NASIS.
Upon successful completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the county
coverages, feature file and the metadata were electronically

The spatial data underwent a quality control review by soil and
cartographic staff at the Findlay, OH MLRA Soil Survey Office.
Cartographic edits for the recorrelation projects were made to a SSURGO
certified dataset downloaded from the Soil Data Mart, August 2011 using
ArcGIS 9.3.  Most spatial edits for the recorrelation projects were made
to change mapunit symbols for recorrelated mapunits and a few edits were
made to some county data sets to create new mapunit polygons.  In
addition, some line work was done to fix polygon join problems at county
and state boundaries for soil map units included in the recorrelation
projects.  Line edits were made with reference to 2006 MrSID (OH) and
2010 NAIP (OH &amp; IN) orthophotography. Cartographic staff made checks and
edits for topologic errors that included common lines and points and
slivers. After a quality assurance review was completed by regional
staff, the seamless county geodatabase for the soil surveys was forwarded
to the certification team at the Michigan Digitizing Unit (MIDU) in
East Lansing, Michigan.
Project: MLRA 111B OH&amp;IN Glynwood/Morley C-slopes; FYs 2009-2011
Initiated to harmonize soil mapunit names and data across MLRA 111B for
glacial till soils on C-slopes.
Early soil surveys in MLRA 111B correlated consociations of Morley
series as both moderately well drained and well drained phases. Glynwood
soil series was later established to replace the moderately well drained
phase, thereby restricting the Morley series to the well drained phase.
Both series were subsequently correlated as consociations on C-slopes.
Soil mapunit transects were completed on 23 map units in 14 counties to
determine map unit composition.  Glynwood soils were found to be the
predominant component in all mapunits. Summaries of the transect data
were used to update tabular data.  Mapunit composition was shown to vary
between ground moraines and end moraines on the till plain, so map unit
phases were developed for both landforms.  Erosion class designations
from the published surveys were retained in the recorrelation.  The 23
map units from non-MLRA areas were recorrelated to 6 regional mapunits
for MLRA 111B.  Approved at the August 2011 project completion review.

The spatial data for the entire SSURGO database was recertified in October
of 2019 to reduce storage requirements and to improve map display
and geoprocessing performance.  The SSURGO data is internally managed
using 12 Regional Transactional Spatial Databases (RTSD) that are in
an ESRI File Geodatabase format.  The spatial extent of the RTSDs follow the
Soil and Plant Science Division (SPSD) regional administrative boundaries.
The XY coordinate system of this RTSD is USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area
Conic USGS Version WKID: 102039 and has an XY storage precision of 0.001
meters.  The RTSDs were recreated using a reduced storage precision of 0.1
meters to reduce the physical size of the data.  The SSURGO data was also
generalized by removing excess vertices, using a tolerance of 1 meter.
The topology was validated at the CONUS level using a tolerance of 0.2

Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.
The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.
Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.
The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.
The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.
Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
