title: "Experimental design"
questions:
- "If I want to conduct an experiment on my land, how can I design it so that the results are meaningful?"
- "How can I program that design into my equipment?"
objectives:
- "Describe key principles to follow when designing an agricultural experiment"
- "Generate an experimental design to test yield response to nitrogen for a given field"
- "Create a file that can be used to program an experimental design into equipment"
- "Identify the time window during which proper experimental design takes place (i.e., how long before planting etc.)."
keypoints:
- "Blocking and randomization improve our power to detect true relationships between inputs and outputs."
